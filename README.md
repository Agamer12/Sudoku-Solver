# Sudoku-Solver

This code is a C# implementation of the Sudoku puzzle solving algorithm. It takes a 2D array as input and uses backtracking to find a solution to the puzzle. The code first checks if the current row and column are the last cell in the grid. If they are, it returns true as it has found a solution. If the current cell is not empty, it calls the solveSudoku method with the next cell. If the current cell is empty, it loops through numbers 1 to 9 and checks if each number is a safe placement using the isSafe method. If the number is safe, it assigns it to the current cell and calls the solveSudoku method with the next cell. If a solution is found, it returns true, otherwise it backtracks and tries the next number. The code also has options for inputting the puzzle one by one or as a whole string. It also has a print method to display the puzzle and a count variable to keep track of the number of iterations.
